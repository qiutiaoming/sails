/*
NOTE:

Most of the contents of this file could be eventually migrated into the prototypes of the `req` and `res` objects
we're extending from our Express slave router.  This would also need to happen separately in the HTTP hook (since 
its req and res are distinct), which is why adding the methods via middleware has been a perfectly convenient abstraction
for the time being.

However, this can be rather hard to understand, and as we make an effort to make hooks easier to work with, it may be
wise to abstract these built-in Sails functions in a more declarative way, maybe even outside of hooks altogether.
This is particularly pertinent in the case of errors ( e.g. res.serverError() ).

If you have any ideas, please let me know! (@mikermcneil)
